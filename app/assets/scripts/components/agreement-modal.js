                <p>
                    CiviCDR will request only the information required to assess
                    a partner’s problem and how to assist them. This may include
                    description of problem, measures taken or relevant files.
                    Unless assistance is requested, we will not be privy to
                    incident details between the partner and Service Provider
                    (SP). (Such assistance may be provided where translation or
                    other support is requested.) As a general rule, information
                    requested by CiviCDR and any disclosure of information to
                    SPs, is done on a need-to-know basis, while protecting
                    stakeholders in an incident as much as possible without
                    turning the incident information into void information, not
                    useable for incident handling by the receiving party.
                    Incident information (other than number and type of incidents)
                    will be deleted from the platform once ticket is closed. It
                    will stay in the backup system (for disaster/recovery purpose)
                    and will be kept there for a week before being purged.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Private incident information will never be shared with
                    donors or other stakeholders. Donors will only be privy to
                    threat notifications and quantitative project monitoring
                    data such as number of incidents dealt with. Non-sensitive
                    information related to community threats will be extracted
                    from incidents and shared as a community alert, in order to
                    help prevent other partners avoid similar incidents.
                    Sensitive incident information may be shared privately with
                    specific partners if they are at risk from the incident. All
                    sharing of information will be conducted in coordination and
                    with the approval of the partners concerned. However, where
                    a vulnerability may seriously affect the security of CiviCDR
                    partners, and the relevant partner is non responsive, we
                    reserve the right to notify the affected stakeholders. (See
                    Vulnerability Disclosure Policy below)
                </p>
                <p>
                    CiviCDR and the SPs we work with will handle all information
                    responsibly and protect it against inadvertent disclosure to
                    unauthorised parties. The security of the methods of storing
                    and transmitting information inside or outside the team,
                    will be appropriate to its sensitivity. In general this
                    means that sensitive information will be kept and sent only
                    in encrypted formats or over secure channels – this
                    explicitly includes back-ups of sensitive information.

                    Vulnerability Disclosure Policy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CiviCDR adheres to a do no harm approach. Vulnerabilities
                    reported to CiviCDR which may seriously affect the security
                    of our partners will be disclosed to stakeholders three
                    weeks after the initial report. Extenuating circumstances,
                    such as active exploitation, threats of an especially
                    serious (or trivial) nature, or situations that require
                    changes to an established standard may result in earlier or
                    later disclosure. CiviCDR will work with community members
                    to establish a rating system for vulnerabilities to
                    determine level of seriousness and use it to define what
                    falls under the CiviCDR remit. Until then, determinations
                    will be made by the CiviCDR team and public disclosures will
                    not be made without consultation of its Advisory Committee.
                    It is the goal of this policy to balance the need of the
                    public to be informed of security vulnerabilities with
                    organisations’ need for time to respond effectively.
                </p>
                <p>The general disclosure schedule is as follows:</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Step 1:</strong> Vulnerabilities reported to us will
                    be forwarded to the affected organisation as soon as
                    practical after we receive the report. They will be asked to
                    respond, and if possible, address the issue within a week.
                    If the organisation is responsive and is working to resolve
                    the issue, CiviCDR will either offer support or extra time
                    as appropriate. This will depend on severity of the issue
                    and potential harm.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Step 2:</strong> If there is no response after two
                    weeks the issue may be raised with relevant members of the
                    community or service providers if appropriate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Step 3:</strong> If, a full three weeks after
                    notification, no solution has been reached the issue will be
                    disclosed to stakeholders. This may include the public or
                    donors if deemed appropriate. In extenuating circumstances
                    this disclosure may be reconsidered, especially when the
                    organisation is cooperative and working to fix the issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final determination of a disclosure schedule will be
                    based on the best interests of the CiviCDR community
                    overall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Disclosures made by CiviCDR will include credit to the
                    reporter unless otherwise requested by the reporter. We will
                    apprise any affected vendors of our publication plans and
                    negotiate alternate publication schedules with the affected
                    vendors when required. The name and contact information of
                    the reporter will be forwarded to the affected vendors
                    unless otherwise requested by the reporter. We will advise
                    the reporter of significant changes in the status of any
                    vulnerability he or she reported to the extent possible
                    without revealing information provided to us in confidence.

                    Let someone leave a conversation that makes them
                    uncomfortable, and do not follow people who asked to be left
                    alone. If you discuss difficult topics that may be traumatic
                    for participants, provide warnings so people may leave a
                    conversation or plan coping strategies.

                <p>
                    This code of conduct applies to CiviCDR spaces, but if you
                    are being harassed by a person involved in CiviCDR outside
                    our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all
                    good-faith reports of harassment seriously. This includes
                    harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place
                    at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to
                    exclude people from CiviCDR based on their past behavior,
                    including behavior outside CiviCDR spaces. We will respect
                    confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting
                    victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a
                    person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or
                    privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that
                    doing so will increase the safety of partners or people
                    involved with CiviCDR. We will not name harassment victims
                    without their affirmative consent.

                <p>
                    Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the
                    value of our community for everyone. We want you to be happy
                    in our community as people like you make it a better place.
                    If the person who is harassing you is part of the organising
                    staff, they will recuse themselves from handling your
                    incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.

                <h2 className="heading--small">Consequences</h2>
                <p>
                    Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are
                    expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in
                    harassing behavior, Response Team may take any action they
                    deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all
                    CiviCDR spaces and identification of the participant as a
                    harasser to other CiviCDR members or the general public.
